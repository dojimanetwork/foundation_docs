### **Introduction**

The Ragno Network serves as a decentralised marketplace for Layer 1 networks, and in some cases, Layer 2s or sovereign chains. It weaves together various L1 networks to provide unified access points for cross-chain protocols, L2s, and omnichain applications. Think of it as a decentralised RPC service provider for an extensive suite of chains.

### **Problem Statement**

Current Web3 environments suffer from fragmentation, with disparate L1s operating in silos. This leads to inefficiencies and limited interoperability.

### **Solution**

Ragno Network aggregates these L1s into a cohesive marketplace, offering endpoints that enable seamless integration and communication for omnichain applications and protocols.

### **Users**

- Cross-chain protocols
- Layer 2 networks seeking interoperability
- Developers of omnichain applications

### **Examples**

A cross-chain DeFi protocol integrating multiple L1s through Ragno Network, enabling users to seamlessly move assets across chains.
