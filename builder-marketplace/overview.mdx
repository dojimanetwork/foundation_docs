The Builder Marketplace is a next-generation ecosystem designed to streamline cross-chain commu-
nication for decentralized applications (dApps) by leveraging a network of modular solvers. These
solvers integrate existing blockchain protocols across multiple chains, ensuring seamless interoper-
ability and enhanced functionality for dApps. Our approach is unique in that we aggregate existing
protocols from all blockchain networks and create modular representations of each dApp within our
architecture. These dApp modules encapsulate all relevant information about a given application,
enabling official teams to access, manage, and update their modules through a dedicated dashboard,
similar to how APIs are managed and deployed on platforms like Postman today.

Beyond these dApp modules, developers can build customized solvers by merging functionali-
ties from multiple modules. This allows for flexible and composable solutions, ensuring seamless
cross-communication between solvers while optimizing execution paths. The Builder Marketplace
supportsuniversaltransactionflows, cateringtointent-centricapplications, AIagents, anddirectAPI
calls from frontend applications. In addition, these specialized and base solvers feature dedicated
interfaces, which can be used by intent-centric protocols and AI agents, further enhancing the interoperability, efficiency, and scalability of decentralized applications. By providing a structured yet
adaptable framework, the Builder Marketplace serves as a powerful foundation for the next wave of
blockchain-powered innovations.

By focusing on solver-driven execution, cross-chain interoperability, and a modular architecture,
the Builder Marketplace empowers developers to create highly efficient and scalable solutions for
decentralized applications. This ecosystem bridges the gap between disparate blockchain networks,
offering a unified platform for seamless transaction execution and inter-chain communication.
