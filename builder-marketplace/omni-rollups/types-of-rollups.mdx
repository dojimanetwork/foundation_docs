title: 'Different Types of Rollups'
---

We are considering all different possibilities for cross-chain rollups. Along with omni-rollup, we are
going to support existing and any private rollup as well with our cross-chain ecosystem.

• **Omni Rollup with Shared Executor**
This architecture leverages a shared executor to oversee the states of all supported chains
within a unified framework. The shared executor ensures efficient processing of cross-chain
transactions while maintaining isolated state management for each chain, preventing conflicts,
and preserving chain-specific integrity. This design simplifies interchain communication, but it
necessitates robust mechanisms to mitigate state interference and establish trust in the shared
execution layer. It is particularly well-suited for streamlined cross-chain dApps that benefit
from a unified transaction coordinator.

• **Omni Rollup with Dedicated Executors for Each Chain**

In this setup, each supported chain operates with its own dedicated execution layer, ensuring
autonomous state management while remaining part of the broader omnichain framework.
This modular architecture improves resilience and scalability by isolating execution respon-
sibilities per chain. However, advanced protocols are required for interoperability to ensure
seamless cross-chain consistency and coordination. This approach is ideal for applications that
require independent chain control in conjunction with flexible and efficient cross-chain interactions

• **Adapter-Enabled Omni Rollup**

This approach builds on existing roll-up infrastructures, transforming them into omni-chain
runs through the use of adapters or clients. These adapters facilitate seamless cross-chain
communication and functionality without requiring significant modifications to the existing
rollup architecture. This method provides a low-barrier entry for projects to integrate into
the omnichain ecosystem while preserving their original operational framework. It enables a
smooth transition of legacy roll-ups into the omnichain paradigm with minimal disruption.

• **Private Omni Rollup for Enterprise Use**

A private omnichain rollup is tailored for enterprise entities to facilitate secure and controlled
cross-chain operations. These rollups are maintained by the enterprise itself, with full auton-
omy over the network execution, consensus, and state management. Designed for privacy and
control, they are ideal for corporate applications such as cross-chain payments, supply chain
tracking, and private inter-organization workflows. Enterprise solutions requiring controlled,
private, and efficient cross-chain infrastructure.
