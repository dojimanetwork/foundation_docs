title: 'Intent Standardization'
---

To enable seamless cross-chain intent execution beyond Ethereum, ERC-7683 (Ethereum Cross-
Chain Intent Standard) must be extended to support multiple Layer 1 (L1) chains. This requires
a standardization layer that translates diverse intent formats from various chains into a unified stan-
dard intent format. The standard intent is then processed by a solver network, where each solver
operates as an omni rollup and executes transactions across multiple L1s through chain-specific
adapters.
