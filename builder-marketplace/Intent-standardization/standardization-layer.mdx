title: 'Standardization Layer'
---


The Standardization Layer acts as the universal interpreter for intents, ensuring that any user-
submitted intent—whether from Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Cosmos, or other L1s—is converted
into a common format. This allows solvers to process and optimize execution without being con-
strained by chain-specific differences.

The unified intent format will include:
- Intent Type: Swap, bridge, stake, borrow, lend, liquidate, etc.
- Source and Destination Chains
- Assets and Amounts
- Execution Preferences: Slippage tolerance, gas fee preferences, execution deadline.
- Security Conditions: Required confirmations, fraud-proof verification, authentication.

The conversion process is handled through intelligent parsers that extract intent data from L1-
native formats (such as Ethereum calldata, Solana transaction instructions, or Cosmos IBC packets)
and translate it into the standardized format.
