The Solver Network is a peer-to-peer collaborative network of omni-rollup solvers, each operating
independently while cooperating dynamically to optimize intent execution. Each solver is deployed
as an omnirollup, ensuring scalability, decentralization, and security. The network supports both
simple and complex intents, leveraging netting mechanisms and liquidity rebalancing to enhance
execution efficiency while minimizing capital lockup.

Each solver runs its own Linera microchain based omni rollup, enabling independent processing of intents while maintaining full interoperability across the Solver Network. Each microchain
consists of: Rust-based execution logic for handling transactions. Cross-chain address management
to interact with various blockchains. Base API services for mempool scanning, netting, and solver
coordination.
