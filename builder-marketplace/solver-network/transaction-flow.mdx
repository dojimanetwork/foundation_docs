title: 'Transaction Flow'
---

The transaction flow in the Builder Marketplace is designed to accommodate multiple types of trans-
actions, ensuring seamless execution from the initiation to the final settlement. The different types
of transaction include intent-centric transactions, AI-driven transactions, and direct API call transac-
tions. Below is a breakdown of the transaction flow:

• **Transaction Initiation**:
Transactions can be initiated through intent-centric applications, AI agents, or direct API calls
from front-end applications. Once a transaction request is submitted, the solver network ana-
lyzes it and determines the most efficient execution route.

• **Solver Selection and Processing**:
The appropriate solver or group of solvers is chosen based on the characteristics of the transac-
tion. They validate the transaction by verifying the input dependencies and feasibility. Crypto-
graphic signatures are used to ensure authenticity. Solvers analyze pending intents and attempt
netting optimizations. If netting is insufficient, solvers coordinate execution using peer-to-peer
liquidity sharing. Solvers bundle transactions and send them to the Omni Sequencer for order-
ing.

• **Cross-Chain Communication and Execution**:
For cross-chain transactions, the solvers communicate through the microchain structure, uti-
lizing integrated blockchain protocols for efficient execution. When omni-rollup handling is
required, solvers bundle the transaction and forward it to the Omni Sequencer, which orga-
nizes and submits it to the appropriate rollup for execution.

• **Finalization and Settlement**:
For omni-rollup transactions, the solver network monitors transaction progress, providing pre-
confirmation and final confirmation updates. In the case of direct Layer 1 (L1) settlements, the
solver collaborates with Hermes validators to execute the transaction. The final transaction
state is then recorded on the relevant blockchain, ensuring both transparency and immutability.

• **Confirmation and Feedback**: Users receive updates on transaction status in real time through the interface of the solver net-
work. The system is designed to ensure efficient and secure transaction completion, optimizing
minimal latency while maintaining maximum security.

This structured transaction flow ensures that the Builder Marketplace efficiently handles adiverse
range of transactions while maintaining high performance, security, and scalability.
