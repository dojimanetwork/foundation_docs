title: "Peer-to-Peer Solver Collaboration and Netting System"
---

Unlike traditional execution models that rely on direct liquidity consumption, the Solver Network
first attempts to net out user intents before executing them on-chain. This is achieved by matching
complementary intents in a shared mempool, reducing the reliance on external liquidity. For ex-
ample: If User A submits an intent to swap ETH→ USDC, and User B submits an intent to swap
USDC → ETH, solvers can net these transactions out internally, allowing A and B to swap without
affecting liquidity reserves. More complex intents—such as multi-hop swaps, cross-chain arbitrage,
and lending liquidations—can be batched into netted sets where one set of transactions offsets the
other. Each netted batch is designed to minimize slippage, reduce gas fees, and optimize execution.

Solvers continuously scan the mempool to find optimal netting opportunities, ensuring that user
intents are fulfilled with minimal external liquidity impact. If netting is not possible, solvers proceed
with direct execution using their available liquidity or by coordinating with other solvers.
