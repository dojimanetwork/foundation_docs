In the context of the Omnichain Solver using a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), the process of generating TEE-proof is significantly more efficient than Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), which requires predefined circuits for each program. Hereâ€™s how it works for the Omnichain Solver:

### TEE-Proof Generation Considerations:

1. **Trusted Execution Environment**:
   Each TEE device used by the Omnichain Solver is verified and registered on the network, ensuring the execution environment is secure and trusted. This validation process involves checking device integrity, which helps establish a "confidential level" of the TEE.

2. **Security of Cryptographic Keys**:
   In the TEE, the keys used to sign proofs are securely derived within the environment. Through mechanisms like Key Hierarchy and Key Rotation, the safety of these cryptographic keys is assured. This ensures that any signed data or proof from the TEE can be trusted, as it originates from a secure environment.

### Execution and Proof Generation:

The Omnichain Solver will utilize a Virtual Machine running inside the TEE to perform its computations. A dedicated key, derived within this VM, is used by the Solver to sign the output of the execution, generating a verifiable TEE-proof. For instance, the Solver can use ECDSA signatures for verifiable proofs on networks like Ethereum. This TEE-proof assures users that the computation results are secure and have not been tampered with.

By integrating TEE-proof generation into the Omnichain Solver, the Builder Marketplace ensures that decentralized applications can verify computations securely and efficiently, bridging the gap between traditional ZKP methods and scalable, hardware-based secure computation.
