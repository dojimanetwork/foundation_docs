## Transaction Flow and Execution

The transaction work flow within the Omni Rollup is a multistag eprocess designed for efficiency, scalability, and cross-chain synchronization. Transactions can originate from various sources, including
user submissions, application interactions, or solvers, and are directed to the Omni Sequencer via
mempools or other submission mechanisms. Additionally, the sequencer can directly accept transactions initiated on Layer 1 (L1) blockchains through a crawler. The crawler captures and validates
these L1 transactions, forwarding them to the Omnichain Engine for direct settlement on the originating L1 chain, bypassing rollups when necessary.

Once transactions are received, the sequencer organizes them based on predefined criteria such
as the target blockchain, the type of operation, or the priority. Within each group, the sequencer
determines an optimized execution order to maintain consistency and minimize resource overhead.
The ordered transactions are compiled into bundles, with each bundle containing essential meta data,
including source and destination chain IDs, timestamps, transaction payloads, and unique nonces to
prevent replay attacks.

To ensure transaction integrity, the Omni Sequencer uses a commitment mechanism. After compiling and ordering the bundles, it generates a cryptographic hash of the ordered transaction list,
referred to as the commitment. This hash is published on the Data Availability (DA) Layer, ensuring
transparency and allowing participants to validate the accuracy of the transaction order by comparing the commitment with the actual processing sequence during execution.

The sequencer then distributes the bundled transactions to the appropriate rollups for execution.
Each rollup begins by verifying the transaction order against the commitment published on the DA
layer, ensuring alignment with the global sequence determined by the sequencer. Transactions are
processed in accordance with this verified order, and the rollup computes state transitions for the
respective blockchain or application.

To guarantee security and integrity, the rollup uses zero-knowledge (zk) proofs generated by
the Prover Network. These zk proofs validate the correctness of state transitions without exposing
sensitive data, ensuring that the process is both tamperproof and privacy-preserving. For contract enabled blockchains, rollups interact directly with smart contracts to manage state updates, validate
proofs, and finalize transactions on the L1 chain. For blockchains without smart contract support,
the rollup uses direct addresses, also known as vaults, as custodial points for assets and data. These
vaults ensure that transactions and state updates are accurately reflected despite the lack of native
contract capabilities.

In both cases, rollups send the updated states and zk proofs to the respective L1 chains for inclusion in their blocks. This ensures that state changes are synchronized across the network, maintaining consistency across all connected chains. By supporting both direct L1 transactions and rollupbased processing, Omni Rollup establishes a robust, scalable, and trustless framework for crosschain transactions, enhancing interoperability, and ensuring data integrity across diverse blockchain
ecosystems.
