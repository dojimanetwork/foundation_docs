## Omni Sequencer: The Core of the Omnichain Stack

The Omni Sequencer is the foundational component of the Omnichain Stack, acting as the central
coordination layer for Omni Rollups. It ensures seamless cross-rollup execution, atomic transaction
processing, and efficient bundling of transactions across multiple rollup environments. By integrating
with both converted L2 rollups (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and Movement Labs rollups)
and native Omni-rollups, the Omni Sequencer transforms them into fully interoperable Omnichain
ecosystems.

**Key Functional Modules of the Omni Sequencer**

1. Simulation Module: Ensures atomic execution of transactions across multiple rollups. Simu-
lates transactions before execution to guarantee validity and prevent failures. Reduces trans-
action reverts by pre-validating state transitions before final submission.

2. StrategyModule: Manages transaction ordering and execution logic for cross-rollup transaction
bundles. Determines execution priorities based on efficiency, MEV considerations, and state
dependencies. Optimizes for low-latency execution and economic efficiency.

3. Omni Rollup Execution Runtime: Queries and simulates transaction execution across multi-
ple chains. Facilitates state-aware cross-rollup communication by ensuring each transactionâ€™s
dependencies are met. Enhances developer experience by abstracting cross-chain execution
complexity.

4. Aggregate Mempool: Collects both bundled and individual transactions before execution. Op-
timizes block space usage by prioritizing transactions based on gas efficiency and finality re-
quirements. Reduces fragmentation in cross-rollup transaction processing.

5. Data Availability Integration: The Omni Sequencer integrates with multiple DA layers (Data
Availability layers) while also maintaining its own Omnichain Data Availability Layer. En-
hances data integrity, accessibility, and redundancy across connected rollups. Ensures seamless
rollup-to-rollup communication without external dependencies on third-party DA layers.

By anchoring the Omnichain Stack, the Omni Sequencer enables true interoperability across rollups.
It bridges fragmented L2 ecosystems into a unified execution environment, ensuring that transactions
across different chains execute atomically, efficiently, and securely. With its integration of cross-
rollup mempools, simulation layers, and DA enhancements, the Omni Sequencer is a game-changer
in modular blockchain architecture.
