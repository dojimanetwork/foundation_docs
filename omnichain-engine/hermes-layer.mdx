title: 'Hermes Layer'
---

The **Hermes Layer** is the core interoperability and liquidity management module of the Omnichain Engine, ensuring smooth cross-chain interactions.

### **Key Responsibilities**

1. **Liquidity Management**

   * Oversees native token liquidity from all blockchains.

   * Manages staking and rewards for liquidity providers.

2. **Validator Operations**

   * Ensures validator functionality, slashing mechanisms, and network security.

3. **Fee Collection and Distribution**

   * Collects transaction fees and redistributes them efficiently within the network.

4. **Universal Cross-Chain Liquidity Access**

   * Offers developers access to liquidity across chains for seamless integration and operation.

### **Main Modules**

1. **Narada**

   * Connects clients to the Hermes Layer.

   * Monitors blockchain events (e.g., token swaps between chains) and relays them to the Hermes Layer in a compatible format.

2. **Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)**

   * Secures liquidity held in the Hermes Layer.

   * Supports various signature mechanisms, including ECDSA, RSA, and ed25519.

3. **Fortunas**

   * Vaults holding liquidity of multiple tokens.

   * Ensures liquidity release through validator signatures (â…” quorum).

4. **Sors**

   * Handles small token swap amounts efficiently, mitigating delays in TSS processes.
