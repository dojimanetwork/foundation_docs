The **Omnichain Engine** consists of two primary layers that ensure secure, efficient, and interoperable functionality:

1. **Dojima Chain**: An EVM-compatible blockchain designed for seamless integration of assets, NFTs, and DeFi applications across diverse blockchain ecosystems.
2. **Hermes Layer**: A liquidity and interoperability layer built on the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, connecting the Dojima Chain with various blockchains.

Together, these components empower developers to create cross-chain applications with ease, enhancing the reach and utility of Web3 technologies.
