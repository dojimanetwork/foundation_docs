### **Introduction**

The Omnichain Stack represents the third layer of the Dojima Network v2 architecture. It focuses on converting existing L2 stacks into omnichain versions, offering a comprehensive solution for verifiable computation through its integrated ZKVM, known as the OmniZKVM.

### **Problem Statement**

L2s and rollups operate in isolated environments, limiting their interoperability and the potential for verifiable computations.

### **Solution**

The Omnichain Stack transforms traditional L2s into omnichain rollups. It includes the OmniZKVM for creating verifiable computations and proof generation, integrated closely with the Prover Network.

### **Users**

- Major L2s aiming for omnichain functionality
- Developers seeking a unified environment for deploying omnichain rollups
- Projects requiring verifiable computations

### **Examples**

An L2 DEX utilizes the Omnichain Stack to become an omnichain rollup, offering users cross-chain trading with verifiable transaction proofs.
