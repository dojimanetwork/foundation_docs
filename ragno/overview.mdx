- Derivation layer is termed as [ragno network](https://main.d3d3wpz0uffins.amplifyapp.com/).
- Ragno network is a decentralised node market place for L1 chains.
- It powers data of different blockchains for dojima cross-chain protocol.
- Future goal is to scale ragno as a decentralised data provider for all L1 and L2 chains.

### Main Components

  **Operators**

- Operators are main actors of ragno network.
- They host nodes of their choice as part of ragno network.
- Operators are onboarded on hermes chain by staking minimum number of $DOJ tokens
- Operators earn rewards in $DOJ tokens for providing data to dojima chain.

**Operator dashboard**

- Dashboard allows operators to host nodes of their choice.
- Staked operators can login to operator dashboard using their private key.
- The node gets up and running with few clicks.
- Operators can view logs and statistics of different nodes they launched through this dashboard.
- It also lets operators import the nodes hosted elsewhere to earn extra-rewards by providing data to dojima x-chain protocol.

**Operator gateway server**

- A gateway server gets spinned up for every operator once he stakes and become part of operator set.
- Gateway server lets crawler nodes(This nodes are reponsible for filtering dojima x-chain transactions) access data in secure and fast manner.
- Every request from crawler node goes through gateway server.
