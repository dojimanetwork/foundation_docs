At Dojima Labs, we tackle one of the most pressing challenges in the Web3 ecosystem: interoperability. Our north star is to create a unified layer that seamlessly connects all blockchains and rollups, mirroring the fluid interaction of the web, by leveraging modular blockchain technology and user-centric design principles. By focusing on simplifying cross-chain technical integrations, eliminating fragmented liquidity, and significantly enhancing user experience, we are driven to make Web3 more accessible and efficient for developers and users alike.

### Introducing Ragno Network
Ragno Network is revolutionizing the way cross-chain protocols interact with Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains. Built to solve critical challenges like fragmented liquidity, complex cross-chain integrations, and suboptimal user experiences, Ragno provides a decentralized node marketplace that powers blockchain data for the Dojima cross-chain protocol and beyond.

**Our Vision**: To become the leading decentralized data provider for L1 and L2 chains, enabling efficient, scalable, and secure cross-chain interactions for validators, light clients, and other network participants.

### **The Problem**

### Cross-Chain Complexity and Infrastructure Costs

As cross-chain protocols grow, they need to interact with multiple Layer 1 blockchains, each with their own unique infrastructure requirements. Validators face two major challenges:

1. **Maintaining Multiple RPC Endpoints**: Validators must set up and manage multiple RPC nodes to track data across several chains.
2. **Running Full Infrastructure Nodes**: Validators may need to operate full infrastructure nodes for each L1 blockchain, incurring significant operational costs.

**The Costs**:

- Running a single L1 node costs approximately **$500 per month**.
- Validators interacting with 10 L1 blockchains may face costs of up to **$5,000 per month**.
- For a decentralized network with 100 validators, this can add up to **$500,000 per month**—just for basic infrastructure.

This creates massive inefficiencies, as each validator is duplicating infrastructure with no added value.

### **The Solution: Ragno Network**

Ragno Network tackles these inefficiencies head-on by providing a **shared infrastructure for cross-chain protocols and light clients**. Instead of validators managing costly infrastructure for each L1 blockchain, Ragno offers **pre-existing, decentralized L1 infrastructure** that validators can leverage.

### **Key Benefits**

- **Cost Savings**: Validators can reduce infrastructure costs by **10x to 100x**. No need to run or maintain separate nodes for each blockchain.
- **Increased Efficiency**: Ragno's decentralized network enables secure, reliable cross-chain data interactions without the complexity and high costs of running multiple L1 nodes.
- **Decentralized & Secure**: Built on strong cryptographic principles, Ragno Network is designed for high levels of decentralization and security. This ensures trustworthy cross-chain data interactions.
- **Modular Infrastructure**: Ragno Network offers true modularity by decoupling the data layer from execution. This allows for:
    - **Flexible, Efficient Data Indexing**: Optimized for different chain integrations.
    - **Faster Transaction Mapping**: Streamlining the process for reduced transaction costs and faster integration with new blockchains.

### **The Future of Decentralized Data**

Ragno Network’s goal is to become the **decentralized data backbone** for all L1 and L2 chains. By offering a more efficient, scalable, and secure solution, Ragno aims to unlock the full potential of cross-chain protocols while drastically reducing operational overhead for validators.
