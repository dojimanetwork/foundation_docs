### Working of the above setup

- Every actor(operator, crawler) in the cross-chain protocol has given a identity on hermes chain.
- Hermes onboards operators who run nodes of different chains.
- Operators run nodes of their choice and register them back on hermes chain.
- Hermes periodically(for every 200 blocks) maps crawlers and operators.
- Crawler node can only request blocks from mapped operator servers.
- Crawlers fetch data from operators and filters dojima x-chain transactions.
- Crawlers batch x-chain transactions and send them to hermes chain for further processing.
- Operators claim their rewards for work done(work done is calculated based on compute units).

### Operator onboarding

- Operator stakes $DOJ tokens using createOperator functionality.
- Once the operator gets added in operator set they host nodes of their choice.
- Every time they run a new node it is updated on hermes through operator dashboard.
- Operator related events are filtered by crawler nodes and stored locally(Any change in operator set is updated locally).

### Crawler node fetching block data from operators

The below component diagram depicts how crawler nodes fetch data from operators.

- The crawler nodes periodically query the operators for new data using a pull-based mechanism.
- Hermes publishes pairing list for every 200 blocks.
- Pairing list states which crawler nodes need to query which operators for blockchain data.
- Based on that crawler nodes fetch blocks and transactions.
