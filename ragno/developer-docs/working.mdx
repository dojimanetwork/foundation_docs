### Operator onboarding

### **Steps to Onboard an Operator**:
1. **Staking $DOJ Tokens**:
    - The operator stakes $DOJ tokens using the `createOperator` functionality.
    - Once the stake is made, the operator is added to the **operator set** in the Hermes chain.
2. **Hosting Blockchain Nodes**:
    - After onboarding, operators host blockchain nodes of their choice.
    - These nodes are registered and managed through the **Operator Dashboard**.
3. **Node Updates**:
    - Whenever a new node is added or updated by an operator, the information is recorded on the Hermes chain via the dashboard.
4. **Crawler Node Tracking**:
    - Crawler nodes continuously monitor the Hermes chain for operator-related events, such as node changes or operator set updates.
    - These events are filtered and stored locally by the crawler nodes to ensure efficient data querying and synchronization.

### **Data Fetching Process**:

1. **Pull-Based Mechanism**:
    - **Crawler nodes** operate on a pull-based mechanism, periodically querying the operators for the latest blockchain data.
2. **Hermes Pairing List**:
    - Every **200 blocks**, the Hermes chain publishes a **Pairing List** (PL).
    - This list assigns specific crawler nodes to operators, detailing which crawlers should query which operators for blockchain data.
3. **Data Requests**:
    - Based on the PL, crawler nodes fetch block and transaction data from the mapped operator's nodes.
    - This data is then processed by the crawlers to filter Dojima cross-chain transactions, which are sent to Hermes for further validation and processing.
