# **How to Add Your Chain to the Dojima Ecosystem**

Integrating your blockchain into the Dojima cross-chain protocol is a straightforward process that ensures seamless interoperability and security. Here’s a simple guide to walk you through it:

### **1. Reach Out to the Dojima Team**

- If your chain runs on **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**, **SVM (Solana Virtual Machine)**, or other **account-based chains**, you're already off to a great start! Just get in touch with the Dojima team, and we’ll help you get things rolling.
- We'll work together to make sure everything aligns with our existing infrastructure so your chain can join the Dojima ecosystem with ease.

### **2. For Non-EVM/SVM Chains**

If your chain doesn’t use EVM, SVM, or isn’t account-based, don’t worry—we’ve got you covered:
    1. **We’ll Handle the Heavy Lifting**:
        - Our team will replicate our **cross-chain magic** (smart contracts and chain client integration) for your chain’s unique stack.
        - This ensures smooth compatibility so your chain can interact with others in the Dojima network without any hiccups.
    2. **Testing, Testing, Testing**:
        - We’ll put your integration through its paces with real-world cross-chain scenarios to ensure everything works perfectly.
        - Once we’re happy with the results, we’ll perform a thorough **security audit** to make sure everything is airtight.

### **3. Node Operators & Staking**

**Operator Support**:
    - If operators within our **Ragno Network** are excited to support your chain and host its nodes, awesome! We’re ready to go.
    
**Staking $DOJ for Rewards**:
    - If operator support isn’t available right away, no problem. Your team can **stake $DOJ tokens** to incentivize operators to host your chain’s nodes. This ensures ongoing support and helps keep things running smoothly.

### **4. What’s Next?**

- We’re always working to make the process smoother and faster. In the future, we might even introduce **permissionless integration** with **automated liquidity pools**, making it even easier to bring your chain into the fold.

Adding your chain to Dojima should be a seamless and secure process, and we're here to help every step of the way. Together, we'll expand the cross-chain universe!
