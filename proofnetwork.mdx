title: 'Proof Network & Omnichain Engine'
---

### **Introduction**

This layer combines the Proof Network and the Omnichain Engine. The Proof Network is a ZK-powered layer, accepting various proof systems and allowing developers to compile their applications into this network (this include modular zkVMâ€™s, zk co-processors, zk Verifiers ). The Omnichain Engine, or Dojima v1, incorporates Hermes, a Cosmos-SDK-based protocol, to process and push these proofs to their respective destinations.

### **Problem Statement**

Integrating zero-knowledge proofs into blockchain applications can be complex and resource-intensive.

### **Solution**

The Proof Network simplifies the generation and distribution of proofs across multiple chains. By integrating with the Omnichain Engine, it efficiently routes these proofs to the appropriate chains.

### **Users**

- L2s aiming to become omnichain
- Developers requiring ZK proofs for their applications
- Cross-chain protocols needing verifiable computations

### **Examples**

An L2 platform integrates with the Proof Network to transform into an omnichain rollup, allowing seamless cross-chain interactions.
