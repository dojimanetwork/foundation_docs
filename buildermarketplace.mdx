### **Introduction**

The Builder Marketplace is the topmost layer of the Dojima Network v2 architecture. It provides an aggregated pool and network of solvers, offering developers a robust infrastructure to fetch APIs from decentralised applications across multiple L1s and L2s. This allows for the creation of customised omni chain applications.

### **Problem Statement**

Developing omnichain applications often requires complex integrations with multiple chains, making it challenging for developers to access and utilise diverse resources.

### **Solution**

The Builder Marketplace aggregates APIs from decentralised apps on various chains, enabling developers to build custom solutions. These solvers provide endpoints on respective L1s for seamless interactions.

### **Users**

- Developers creating omnichain applications
- AI agents executing transactions on behalf of users
- Intent-based protocols requiring customised solutions

### **Examples**

A developer uses the Builder Marketplace to create a custom application involving many chains very easily.
