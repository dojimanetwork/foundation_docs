### **Introduction to Dojima Foundation**

The **Dojima Foundation** is spearheading the development of the **Omnichain Web**, a groundbreaking concept in blockchain interoperability and decentralized infrastructure. By bridging the gaps between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) ecosystems, Dojima Foundation aims to create a truly interconnected Web3 environment where assets, data, and applications flow seamlessly across blockchains. As the parent organization of **Dojima Network**, the foundation drives innovation through its core components: the **Proof Network**, **Ragno Network**, **Omnichain Rollup Stack**, and **Builder Marketplace**.

### **What is the Omnichain Web?**

The **Omnichain Web** is a new paradigm for Web3, enabling comprehensive cross-chain interoperability and unified liquidity management. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on isolated solutions or centralized clearing layers, the Omnichain Web introduces a decentralized and scalable framework that seamlessly connects all major blockchains. It leverages:

- **OmniRollups** for seamless multichain settlements.
- A **Proof Network** for secure and efficient cross-chain verification.
- The **Ragno Network**, a decentralized Layer 1 marketplace.
- A **Builder Marketplace** to empower developers with tools to create intent-based omnichain applications.

This concept redefines interoperability by enabling both new and existing blockchain rollups to integrate into a unified omnichain ecosystem without overhauling their core architecture.
