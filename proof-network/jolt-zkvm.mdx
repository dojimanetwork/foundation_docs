title: 'Jolt zkVM'
---

The paper introduces a novel approach to building zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs)
by leveraging a technique called Jolt. This method focuses on transforming program execution into
a series of lookups into a predetermined, extensive lookup table, thereby enhancing efficiency and
auditability in zkVMs.

• **Lookup Singularity Vision**: Jolt realizes the "lookup singularity" concept, aiming to design circuits that primarily perform lookups into a massive,predetermined table. This table, dependent
solely on the instruction set architecture (ISA), is structured to avoid costs that scale linearly
with its size, despite its theoretical enormity (e.g., size exceeding 2128).

• **Lasso Lookup Argument**: To validate the lookups efficiently, Jolt employs a new lookup argu-
ment called Lasso, detailed in a companion work by Setty, Thaler, and Wahby. Lasso enables
efficient proofs of correct execution by performing multiple lookups into smaller subtables and
combining the results, facilitating the handling of massive structured tables without incurring
prohibitive costs.

• **Application to RISC-V ISA**: The paper demonstrates the application of Jolt to the RISC-V ISA,
a widely adopted open standard. For 64-bit data types, the dominant cost for the Jolt prover
is cryptographically committing to approximately six 256-bit field elements per RISC-V CPU
step. This performance is favorable compared to prior zkVM providers, even those focused on
simpler VMs.

• **Performance and Auditability Benefits**: Jolt offers significant performance improvements and
enhanced auditability over previous zkVMs. By reducing complex computations to structured
table lookups, it simplifies the verification process and reduces the computational burden on
the prover, leading to more efficient and transparent zkVM implementations.

### Distributed Deployment of Jolt zkVM

Deploying the Jolt zkVM in a distributed form brings several advantages by leveraging a network
of provers to parallelize computation and enhance scalability. Distributes computation of zk proofs
across multiple nodes, significantly reducing the time required for proof generation. Increases resilience by ensuring that proof generation can continue even if some nodes in the network fail.
Dynamically allocates workloads across nodes, ensuring efficient resource utilization. By deploying
nodes geographically closer to the data sources or target blockchains, latency is minimized, and
overall throughput is enhanced.

The modular architecture of the Jolt zkVM is the cornerstone of efficient and isolated state management across multiple blockchains. By integrating specialized virtual machine modules, such as
the EVM Module, SVM Module, MoveVM Module, and WASM Module, the zkVM can simultaneously
maintain the states of various chains in a unified, yet independent manner, ensuring both interoperability and operational isolation. The EVM Module is designed to handle Ethereum compatible
chains, providing robust support for Solidity-based smart contracts and facilitating seamless state
transitions within the Ethereum ecosystem. The SVM Module caters to Solana-compatible chains,
leveraging Solana’s high-performance architecture to enable rapid transaction processing and execution. The MoveVM Module enables compatibility with Move-based blockchains, such as Aptos and
Sui, by using Move’s resource-oriented programming model to enhance security, parallel execution,and asset integrity. The WASM Module supports chains based on WebAssembly (WASM), offering
developers the flexibility to build and run applications in diverse programming languages such as
Rust, C++, and more.
This modularity not only enhances the zkVM’s ability to manage cross-chain interactions efficiently but also provides a scalable framework for supporting an expanding ecosystem of blockchains
with varying technical requirements. The combination of distributed deployment and modularity in
the Jolt zkVM sets a new standard for zkVMs, providing unparalleled scalability,flexibilityand crosschain capabilities to power the next generation of blockchain applications.
