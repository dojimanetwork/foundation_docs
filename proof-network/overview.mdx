The Proof Network consists of prover nodes running zkVM, offering critical support to the Omnichain Web by generating zero-knowledge proofs as needed. These proofs cover a wide range of use cases, including validating rollup transactions, enabling trustless cross-chain bridging (between modular Data Availability layers and various L1 chains), and supporting applications like decentralized oracles and coprocessors. This proof generation helps maintain a secure, scalable, and interoperable ecosystem across multiple blockchain layers.
