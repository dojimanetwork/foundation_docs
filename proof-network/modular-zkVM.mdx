title: 'Modular zkVM'
---

Our modular zkVM will integrate a variety of proof systems like Groth16, Plonk, zkSTARK, HyperPlonk, and Binius, each offering distinct advantages based on trade-offs in proof size, computational efficiency, and security. In modular zkVM, **Groth16** could be used for cases demanding ultra-small proof sizes, **Plonk** or **HyperPlonk** might be chosen for general-purpose applications due to their flexibility and reduced setup needs, **zkSTARKs** would be preferred in scenarios demanding transparency and post-quantum security. This modular approach allows developers to select the most appropriate system without overhauling the underlying zkVM framework.

Moreover, we are planning to enable aggregation of different types of proofs using recursive proof system. Recursive proof systems enable the zkVM to combine multiple proofs into a single, compact proof. This process drastically reduces verification costs and time, especially when dealing with complex computations or aggregating proofs across different chains. For example, if a zkVM needs to verify multiple **Plonk** and **zkSTARK** proofs, it can use a recursive SNARK to aggregate these into one succinct proof. The recursive process essentially proves that proofs have been verified, creating a chain of trust that is efficient to validate.

Recursive proofs reduce the need to verify each proof individually, which saves computational resources and enhances throughput. This is particularly important for rollups and multichain scenarios where multiple transactions need to be verified simultaneously. By enabling the aggregation of different proof types, modular zkVMs facilitate interoperability across various Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains, making them ideal for cross-chain applications.

In essence, modular zkVMs with recursive proof capabilities are set to become foundational components in the future of blockchain, driving scalability and interoperability across diverse platforms.
